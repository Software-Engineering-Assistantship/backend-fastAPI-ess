## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.10

### Installing

Clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running MongoDB with Docker üê≥

## First time running?


Run the follow scripts to build the images

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

## Running Database

Run docker compose

```sh
docker-compose up
```

If you want to run the docker container without watch the logs, you can run 

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the docker container, just run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Environment

This project uses `.env` files to manage database environment variables (you can create it from .`env.example`).

# Running the FastAPI server ü¶Ñ

To start the server, run the following command:

```sh
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

This command will run the Uvicorn compiler in watch mode, so every time a modification occurs the server restarts.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are used in the project:

- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): A simple way to manage your environment variables in python scripts.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/): An ASGI web server implementation for Python.
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/): The most widely used data validation library for Python.
- [Pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html): A Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB, and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from Python.
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/): Framework that makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.
- [Pytest-BDD](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-bdd/): Library for Pytest that implements a subset of the Gherkin language to enable automating project requirements testing and to facilitate behavioral driven development.
